Pre-processing
In wanting to remove companies from the dataset that had less than 3 years of data, we applied two methods (looking at distinct and consecutive years) and found a discrepancy in the number of remaining values. In trying to understand this, we identified the issue: some companies had entire missing years. This motivated our decision to remove these companies entirely from the dataset for two reasons:
1.	The model would incorrectly use data from two years back (given it looks at the previously available year) which wouldnâ€™t fit our goal of only wanting to look at data from the previous year
2.	Imputing the values would introduce a lot of additional assumptions that could reduce the accuracy of our results and require additional computational power/resources that would be more suitable for a longer-term project 
As a result, our pre-processing involved:
1.	Removing companies that had entire missing years
